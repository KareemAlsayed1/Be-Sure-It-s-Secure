# Be-Sure-It-s-Secure
 A part of Egypt's 2030 vision is to own a digitalized technological industrial base. That’s because one of the industrial challenges is using outdated technologies that fail to compete with developed countries regarding quality and productivity. These outdated technologies are being used in the factory’s transportation, safety, and security systems. “Be Sure It’s Secure” is a workable real prototype for a proposed solution to this challenge. It took a year to construct this prototype from scratch from Jan 2017 to Jan 2018.

The proposed solution focused on three main aspects - Transportation, Security, and Safety and the network connection between them. Regarding transportation, we proposed a robot design that carries the materials through the different stages of production. That robot follows a specific line in the factory and has the ability to indicate any obstacles. Also, it can be easily tracked through a central control panel. The safety system tracks the machines’ temperature every minute and indicates any unusual change. Also, the safety system has control over the cooling systems in the machines, and it has the ability to suck the smoke outside the factory in case of any fires. This system is directly connected to the central control panel. Finally, the security system monitors the activities done inside the factory and has 3D surveillance cameras. Also, it is connected to the central control panel and takes control in case of emergencies.

“Be Sure It’s Secure” Claimed the 1st place out of 500+ participants in Intel ISEF Egypt competition in the embedded systems category.
